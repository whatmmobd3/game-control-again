    <h1>Bind it</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even</li>
      <li>
        The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game
      </li>
      <li>
        When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should
        get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
      </li>
      <li>The event should be listenable from outside the component</li>
      <li>
        When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted
        (clearInterval(ref))
      </li>
      <li>
        A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the
        same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)
      </li>
      <li>Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components</li>
      <li>
        Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently
        in both components
      </li>
